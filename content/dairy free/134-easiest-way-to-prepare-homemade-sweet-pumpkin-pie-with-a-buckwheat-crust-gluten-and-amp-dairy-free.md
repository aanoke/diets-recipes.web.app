recipeinstructions:

- "Put the dough onto a sheet of baking paper. Dust the top with some gf flour. Roll it out and donâ€™t panic when it all falls apart. Push it together with your hands and keep rolling until itâ€™s in a thin circle."
- "Lightly oil your pie tin then flip the pastry over the top. Work quickly to push the sides down gently before they all crack. Use your fingers to push bits of cracked off dough into place in a patchwork technique."
- "Trim the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork then chill in the freezer for 30 minutes."
- "Heat the oven to 200 C then put the case straight from the freezer into the oven. This helps to stop the pastry shrinking. Bake for 15 mins then remove."
- "Now prepare your filling. This bit is easy, simply whisk everything together then pour into your case."
- "Turn your oven down to 160 C. Now you want a long slow bake to set the filling. So bake for 50 minutes here. When the top is set and firm, remove the tin but let the pie sit for a good half an hour before you try to unmould it."
- "Now enjoy all your hard work!"
