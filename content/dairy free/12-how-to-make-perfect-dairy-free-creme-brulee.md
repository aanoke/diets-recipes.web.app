recipeingredient:
- "500 ml Orley Whip"
- "10 ml Vanilla Essence"
- "6 egg Yolks room temperature"
- "90 ml White sugar"
- "90 ml Caster sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 150 degrees C. Place 6 - one cup (240 ml) Crème Brûlée dishes or ramekins in a roasting pan."
- "In a saucepan, over medium-high heat, bring the cream and the vanilla essence to the scalding point (the cream just begins to bubble around the edges)"
- "Meanwhile in a heatproof bowl beat the egg yolks and white sugar until thick and pale."
- "Gradually pour the scalding cream into the egg yolk mixture, making sure you keep whisking constantly so the eggs don&#39;t curdle."
- "Prepare a water bath (bain marie) by carefully pouring enough hot or boiling water so that the water comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for about 30 - 40 minutes (baking time can vary depending on size of ramekins and temperature of water) or just until the custards are set (a slight wobble is okay)."
- "Immediately remove the custards from the water bath and cool to room temperature, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until cold and firm."
- "To serve, remove the custards from the refrigerator. Sprinkle an even, not too thick, layer (about 15ml) of caster sugar over the custards. Using a hand held kitchen torch, or under a very hot preheated broiler, caramelize the sugar until it is golden brown and bubbly. Let sit a few minutes so the sugar can harden then serve."
