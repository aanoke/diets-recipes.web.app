recipeingredient:
- " For the icing"
- "240 g icing sugar pink yellow and orange food colour gel"
- " pink for blue or green to make vegetarian"
- "1 1/2 tbsp sprinkles"
- " vegetable oil for greasing"
- "1 large egg lightly beaten"
- "40 g unsalted butter cubed"
- "300 ml semiskimmed milk"
- "7 g sachet dried yeast"
- "50 g caster sugar"
- "500 g strong white bread flour plus extra for dusting"
- "1 tsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour - Mix together the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and set aside. With adult supervision, put the milk and butter in a small pan and warm over a low heat until the butter has just melted and the milk is steaming. Pour into the well in the flour, then add the egg. Stir until a wet dough forms."
- "Knead the dough -Dust a surface with flour and knead the dough for 10 mins. If it’s too sticky, add extra flour, a little at a time (adding up to 50g). When it’s ready, it should feel elastic, smooth and no longer sticky. Clean and lightly oil the bowl, then put the dough in. Cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rise for about 1 hr or until doubled in volume. Knock the air out of the dough using your fist, then divide it into 15 pieces (each weighing about 60g). Dust the work surfac"
- "Bake the buns -Oil a large baking tray and place the dough on it in rows, leaving a 2cm gap between each piece. Lightly oil a piece of clingfilm and lay it over the buns. Allow to rise in a warm place for 30-45 mins until puffed up and just touching. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Bake for 10 mins or until lightly golden (an adult should take things in and out of the oven). When cool enough to handle, move to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. Gently pull the buns apart."
- "Ice the buns -Divide the icing sugar between 3 wide, lipped bowls, then add 1 tbsp water and a couple of drops of a different food colour gel to each and mix until smooth (a little gel goes a very long way, so just start with small amount). Dip 5 buns into each bowl to just cover the tops with icing, scraping any excess off on the side of the bowl."
- "Sprinkle - Return to the tray and scatter over the sprinkles. Allow to set for 15 mins or until the icing is just hard. Will keep in an airtight container for up to 2 days but are best eaten the day they are iced."
