- "2 tbsp gf flour or plain flour"
- "400 mls or so of almond milk or milk"
- "50 g vegan cheese or cheddar"
- " Nutmeg grated"
- " Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. Set to one side."

- "Lightly grease a baking dish, then layer up your potatoes into the dish."
- "Pour the cheese sauce over the top, cover with foil and bake at 160 C for 1 hour. Remove the foil and turn up the heat to 200 C and let the bake brown for about 20 mins. Check the potatoes are cooked through before serving."
