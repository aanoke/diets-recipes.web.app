recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the two packages of strawberries in slices and put them aside in a bowl"
- "In a large bowl, mix the glaze mix and the sugar with a whip. Next pour the boiling water into the mix slowly, continuously mixing. Mix until the mix has a smooth, gooey texture."
- "Add in the sliced strawberries (keep two slices aside if you want to put some on top like me). Mix with a wooden spoon until the strawberries are fully coated."

Pour the mixture into a small ziploc bag (cut the corner BUT A TINY CUT) and pour the mix on top of the cake, swirling around."
