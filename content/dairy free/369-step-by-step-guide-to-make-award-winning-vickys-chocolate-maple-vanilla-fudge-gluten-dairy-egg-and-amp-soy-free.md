- "1 pinch salt"
- "360 ml full fat coconut milk 15 cups"

recipeinstructions:
- "Use &#39;Pure&#39; Spread (dairy/soy-free), Vitalite (dairy/soy-free), gold foil Stork (dairy/soy-free), coconut oil or if soy isn&#39;t an issue Earth Balance Buttery Spread. Of course you can use dairy butter too"
- "To make the chocolate fudge, put the sugar, cocoa, salt and coconut milk into a saucepan"
- "Heat gently for around 10 minutes or until the sugar has completely dissolved, stirring as it melts together"
- "Turn up the heat and let the mixture come to a slow boil. Don&#39;t stir through this stage, it won&#39;t burn so don&#39;t be tempted. Don&#39;t disturb the mixture yet"
- "Using a candy thermometer, let the mixture reach 234째F / 112C. It will have reduced slightly, look very glossy and the bubbles popping on the surface will be very small and rapid due to the mix having thickened"
- "Carefully take the pan off the heat and add the butter substitute and vanilla. Don&#39;t stir it in yet! The mixture needs to cool to 125째F / 52C first"
- "Meanwhile, line an 8 inch square baking tray or dish with foil, leaving an overhang on 2 sides. Spray the foil lightly with oil"
- "Now that it&#39;s cooled a bit you need to start beating it viciously! You&#39;ll see it lose it&#39;s gloss and turn a matt colour. It&#39;ll feel stiff too. This takes around 10 minutes"
- "Pour the fudge into the lined tray and smooth over the top. At this point you can add a topping if you want to but I like it just the way it is. Let it come to room temperature to set, don&#39;t put it in the fridge"
- "When it&#39;s set, lift it out of the tray using the overhanging foil to pull it out easily and set it down on a chopping board"
- "Cut into squares or slabs. If gifting, slabs are best. You can wrap them in parchment then wrap again in foil. You can use this method to freeze it too, it&#39;ll last 3 months frozen"
- "Keep in a lidded container either refrigerated or at room temp if you prefer your fudge softer"
- "The instructions for maple vanilla fudge are the same as for chocolate flavour"
