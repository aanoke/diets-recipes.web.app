recipeinstructions:

Add more lemonade if you need to make it make it sticky.  Note that fizzy lemonade is hard to measure so let it settle before adding to the mix."

- "Use a round pastry cutter or small glass dipped in flour to cut out scones (5-6cm or about 2&#34; works best) Arrange scones on a lightly-floured tray (or use baking paper). Brush each scone with a little extra milk to glaze."
- "Bake on the top shelf of preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Cooked scones should sound hollow when tapped. Place scones  on a clean tea towel and cover with another tea towel to cool - best eaten as warm and fresh as possible!"
