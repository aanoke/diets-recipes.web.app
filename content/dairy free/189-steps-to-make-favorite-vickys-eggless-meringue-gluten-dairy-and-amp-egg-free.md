recipeingredient:
- "6 tbsp icing sugar"
- "1/4 tsp xanthan gum"
- "1 tsp soya protein from health store"
- "3 tbsp cold water"
- "3/4 tsp apple cider vinegar"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 1/2 tsp more soya protein"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 1/2 (half) / 120C / 250°F and line a baking sheet with baking paper"
- "In a small bowl whisk together the icing sugar, xanthan gum and 1 tsp of soya protein. Set aside"
- "In a large bowl place the water, vinegar, vanilla and the 1 &amp; 1/2 tsps soya protein. Whisk on high speed for up to 10 minutes until it has increased considerably in size, and is fluffy and bubbly"
- "Keeping the whisk on high, add the icing sugar mix, 1 tbsp at a time. The mixture should eventually turn pure white and leave stiff peaks when the whisk is lifted out of the mix - the peaks are not quite as stiff as one would expect from an egg-based meringue"
- "Pipe or spoon the mix onto the lined baking sheet. Put in the oven for 1 - 1.5 hours, until the meringues are totally set and easily peeled off the paper"
- "Remove from oven, let cool and store in an airtight container"
- "I&#39;ll keep trying for a soy-free alternative!"
