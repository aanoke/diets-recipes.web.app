recipeinstructions:
- "Grease and line with parchment a 20cm/8inch cake pan."
- "Prepare the clementines: place the whole clementines into a saucepan. Add enough cold water to come up just below halfway of the clementines and place over a high heat. Bring to the boil, partially cover with a lid and boil for around 1 hour until soft. Keep an eye on it in case the water dries up, you don’t want to burn your saucepan!"
- "Drain, discarding the cooking water. Cut the clementines in half, remove the pips and set aside to cool."
- "Once cool, preheat the oven to put the oven to 180 degrees fan."

- "Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan and bake in the centre of the oven for 50 minutes - 1 hour. A skewer when inserted should come out clean."
- "Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack, but still in the tin. Once cool, you can remove it from the tin and get started on the icing."
- "For the icing: mix together the icing sugar, lime juice and rosewater until a smooth runny-ish paste. If you feel it’s too thick, add a tiny dash of water. Add the pink food colouring and mix well."
- "Brush the icing over the top of the cake only. While still a bit wet, sprinkle over some desiccated coconut."
- "First, prepare the clementines for the cake"
