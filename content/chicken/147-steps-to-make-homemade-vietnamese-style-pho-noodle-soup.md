recipeingredient:
- " Soup"
- "8 cups (1.9 liters) vegetable chicken or beef stock Japanese stock works well too"
- "4 star anise"
- "4 whole cloves"
- "1 cinnamon stick about 3 in"
- "1 thumbsized piece fresh ginger"
- "1 onion cut in quarters"
- "2-4 Tbsp Fish sauce or soy sauce to taste"
- " Noodles and Garnishes"
- "4 serving pho noodles or rice vermicelli"
- " Black pepper optional"
- "1 handful fresh cilantro"
- "1 fresh lime cut in wedges"
- "1 dash your favorite hot chilis optional"
- "300 g boneless chicken cut in slices or for a vegetarian option try fried tofu"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pot, add the stock, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and onion. Bring to a boil, turn to low, then simmer with the lid on for 45 to 1 hour."
- "Strain out the spices and onion, then add 2 Tbsp of fish sauce or soy sauce. Taste the soup and add more if needed (it depends on the kind of sauce you use). * You can do up to this step ahead of time and then just reheat the soup when you are ready to eat."
- "Add some of the soup to a smaller pot and bring to a simmer. Add the sliced meat and cook for 2-3 minutes. If using fried tofu, skip this step. (You can do this in the large pot too, but I found it easier to dish out the meat evenly if it was separate, or if you are not eating all 4 servings)"
- "If using fried tofu, grill it a bit in a frying pan (no oil needed) and cut into thin slices. Put on top of the soup just before serving."
- "Prepare the noodles according to the directions and drain. Some packages tell you to chill the noodles in cold water, but it makes the soup cold so I recommend keeping the noodles hot! (Just make sure you do this just before adding the soup, or else they noodles will stick together)."
- "Divide the noodles among deep soup bowls and dish out the soup with the meat over the noodles."
- "Garnish with fresh lime, chopped chilis, and black pepper. Put the fish sauce/soy sauce at the table in case you need more. Dig in!"
