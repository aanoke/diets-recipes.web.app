Ground chicken breast is a healthy option, but tends to be dry and crumbly. By adding tofu and reducing the amount of binding agent, you can make tender and fluffy meatballs. The cooking liquid is tasty, so do not waste it. The only binding agent I use is an egg, so the meatballs just hold their shape.

Put oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Ground chicken: I highly recommend using ground chicken thighs and not chicken breast. Parmesan and almond flour: Both of these ingredients help keep the juices inside the chicken meatballs while they bake (similar to if you had used breadcrumbs). The parmesan also adds wonderful flavor.
