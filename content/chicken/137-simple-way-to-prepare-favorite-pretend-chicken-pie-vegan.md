recipeingredient:
- "1 block tofu"
- "1/2 tsp paprika"
- "1 onion"
- "2 sticks celery"
- "2 carrots"
- "4 cloves garlic"
- "1 handful mushrooms"
- "1 pepper"
- "1 leek"
- "1 handful green beans"
- " Some peas"
- "1 cup cream alternative"
- "1 handful chopped parsley"
- "1 portion jusrol puff pastry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take your tofu block (you prolly want firm but my local shop only sells silken so I use that and it’s fine) and wrap it up in several layers of kitchen roll then pop a heavy book or two on there to press it for 15mins. This gives it a firmer texture and takes some of the moisture out. You can see I dropped my tofu so there are splatty bits this time"
- "Carefully chop and fry your tofu. When it’s soft, it’ll fall apart just being picked up so be careful. It also spits in the pan. After you’ve cooked two sides they hold together a bit better. Try to ‘seal’ the sides like you would chicken. In the last minute, sprinkle a small amount of paprika over them."
- "Once cooked, pop the tofu on some kitchen roll to get the excess frying oil off, cover with pepper and then set to one side"
- "Finely chop the onion, celery, carrot and garlic. Cook em in a large pan until soft. If you have any white wine or cider, you might wanna add and then simmer away a cup now."
- "Chop and add the rest of the vegetables, then add a cup of veggie stock and any bits of tofu that were too squished or broken to fry. Simmer off lots of the liquid"
- "Add the cream alternative and a cup of frozen (or fresh) peas and the tofu. Make sure it’s all hot and then transfer into a casserole dish. (In retrospect it was too watery this time bc of the extra ice on the peas, be ready to add corn starch if you need to)"
- "Get your block of puff pastry and roll it so that it’s large enough to cover the top of your dish plus an inch each way. Leave it to settle for ten mins as it will shrink. Then plonk it on top of the mix!"
- "Wash the top with some milk or egg alternative to make it shiny! (I forgot) Cook in the oven at 220C (435ishF?) for 12-15 minutes until the pastry is all puffed up and golden."
- "Cut up and seeeerrrrve!"
