The chickpea noodles add protein and texture for the perfect heartiness. Cook the noodles al dente: pasta that is still firm to the bite. I love veganizing classics and this chickpea noodle soup has all the comforting qualities you&#39;d expect in a classic chicken noodle soup, minus the chicken of course. Savory baked tofu, hearty veggies, and a rich cashew cream base go into this luscious vegan spin on cream of chicken soup.
