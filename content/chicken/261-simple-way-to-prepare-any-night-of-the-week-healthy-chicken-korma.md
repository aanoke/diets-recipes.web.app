This Chicken Korma is mild enough to suit all tastes (even kids will enjoy it) but can easily be made spicier. Instead of slow cooking bone-in meat, I have used boneless chicken thighs, which make the cooking process fast enough to whip up the dish on a weeknight. Add pan-fried cashews or raisins as garnish before serving.; Variations.
