- "600 ml glutenfree strong chicken stock"
- "120 ml rice milk  light coconut milk"
- "240 ml full fat coconut milk"
- "100 grams glutenfree plain flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp pepper"

- "1/2 tsp oregano"
- "1/4 tsp dried basil"
recipeinstructions:
- "I use gf chicken bouillon powder and water to make the stock needed for this. I add an extra few tsps of powder to compensate for the extra liquid that you&#39;ll add to the main recipe you&#39;re making the soup for. Knorr brand Stock Cubes are free-from lactose and you can crumble those up if you can&#39;t find their tubs of bouillon. If you don&#39;t use strong stock I find the flavour is too diluted in the main dish"
- "Put the stock and the rice milk (or any milk you prefer) in a pan and bring to the boil"
- "Mix the flour, seasonings and herbs with the coconut milk (or any milk you prefer) until you have a thick mixture"
- "Turn down the heat then add the flour mixture slowly to the pan, whisking continuously"
- "Keep whisking off the heat for a good 3 - 5 minutes to break up any lumps and smooth the soup while the flour flavour cooks out"
- "You can add cooked, chopped chicken if you like or cooked &amp; chopped mushroom or celery to make cream of those soups, around 50 - 60 grams"
- "This recipe will make the equivalent of 2 cans of CONDENSED soup that you can use in recipes where a can of condensed cream soup is an ingredient. You can halve it if desired"
