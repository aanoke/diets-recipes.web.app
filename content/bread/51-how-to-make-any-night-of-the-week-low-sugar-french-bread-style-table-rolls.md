recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Soy flour I used a superfine flour"
- "50 grams Glutenfree flour"
- "100 ml Lukewarm water about 38"
- " A"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil pure"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- " B"
- "2 tsp Artificial sweetener I used Lakanto S"
- "4 grams Yeast Instant"
recipeinstructions:
- "Measure the dry ingredients in a plastic bag, and shake to mix together while incorporating air."
- "Put Step 1 into a bowl, and add in the A ingredients and B ingredients apart from each other (as if dividing them with the flour from Step 1)."
- "Pour the lukewarm water over the B ingredients. Mix with a rubber spatula until everything has come together, and knead by hand."
- "It&#39;s very sticky to start with, but it will become firmer if you keep kneading. When the dough has become glossy, it&#39;s ready."
- "Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll into balls, tucking the cut ends inside. Place them on a baking tray. (Shape into your desired style.)"
- "Pour hot water in a tea cup, and place in an empty space on the baking tray (to maintain the humidity). Let the dough rise for 40 minutes to 1 hour at 35-40℃."
- "Bake for about 15 minutes in an oven preheated to 180-200℃. (If you mist the dough with a water sprayer before baking, the crust will be crispy.)"
- "When they are baked, let cool on a rack, and they are done. (Cover with a foil, if they look like they are going to burn.)"
- "Soy flour bread is easy to brown, so keep an eye on it when you&#39;re baking with it for the first time. By doing so, you won&#39;t fail baking it, and it&#39;s easier to adjust the baking time."
- "If you shape it long and thin, it will be just like grissini bread sticks."
- "If you proof the dough twice as normal, it won&#39;t puff up much while baking. So the bread will turn out dense and heavy."
- "It&#39;s easier to remove the dough from the bowl with a scraper or spatula."
