recipeingredient:
- "493 g strong white bread flour aim for 500g a little less is best as bags of flour are 15kg 3 loaves of bread"
- "7 g easy bake yeast"
- "7-15 g salt"
- " Up to 20g of oil I use rapeseed or sunflower oil"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put dry ingredients in a bowl but keep the yeast and the salt away from each other. Add the oil. Start adding water until it binds (you may need a little more or less water... it can vary with flour but 270ml seems the mean)"
- "Knead for 7-10 mins... use a mixer with a dough hook if you have one. But it&#39;s easy enough to do it by hand (If you have clean hands) Oil a bowl and coat the dough in it too, leave to double in a warm place (about an hour)."
- "Shape as desired and place in an oiled bread pan or tray. I did 8 balls in a bread tin so you can either slice or break off when needed."
- "Allow to double again (45mins to an hour)."
- "Bake at 200 degrees Celsius (180 for a fan oven) for 20-25 mins. Until it sounds hollow when tapped at the bottom once removed from the pan. The variation in time depends on the size and shape of your bread pan."
- "Variations can include adding herbs, garlic, tomato purée, banana, dried fruit... all you need to do is adjust the water to allow for the wetter ingredients!"
