- "Add the rice flour into the bread maker last and place the yeast into the designated chamber."

- "About 15 minutes into the course, open up the bread maker and push any dough that has stuck to the sides back to the bottom of the bread case and incorporate it into the rest of the dough. (My bread maker performs this function automatically.)"

- "If you can&#39;t scrape down any dough that gets stuck to the side of the bread maker you may end up with a bread covered in odd lumps. If that happens then please just cut the lumps away with a knife."
- "Store-bought rice flour mixes often contain thickening agents so I added cornstarch. I&#39;m still trying to decide on the right amount, though."
