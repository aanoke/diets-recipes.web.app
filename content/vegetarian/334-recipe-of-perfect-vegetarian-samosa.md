recipeinstructions:
- "Place all the vegetables, water, stock cubes, curry &amp; Turmeric powder into a saucepan and simmer until soft."
- "Remove the pan from the heat and place the mix into a bowl and slowly add the dried potato powder until it’s thickened. I like to keep it a little moist like a wet mash. Add salt and pepper to taste, then leave to cool."

- "You can also make mini cocktail rolls for party dinner canapés."
- "Preheat your oil to about 180 or (test with a corner to see if it’s bubbling)"
- "I normally put 2 in at a time because it’s easier to manage, they only require about 30 seconds max on each side, then flip over until both sides are golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain on a cooling rack with a catch tray underneath. That’s it, you are ready to serve."
- "They can be made in advance and reheated in an oven, ideal snack and easy to make. If you like spicy food try adding some chilli to the veg mix prior to cooking. As always, enjoy."
