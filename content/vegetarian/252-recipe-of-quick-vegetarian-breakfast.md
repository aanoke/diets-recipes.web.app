- "2 large eggs"
- "2 small avocados"
- "2 small potatoes with or without skin"
- "1/2 red onion"
- "3 bella mushrooms"

- " Olive oil"

recipeinstructions:
- "Slowly heat up a cast iron pan to medium low. In the meantime, mix eggs in a bowl and set side. Dice veggies to your liking. Small potato cubes (&lt; 1/2&#34;) are easiest to brown on a pan and what I prefer."
- "Add oil to heated cast iron and cook eggs to your liking. I like medium low for a cast iron for scrambled eggs because it doesn&#39;t burn the eggs and it&#39;s easier to get fluffy scrambled eggs. I learned from a friend who is a chef at a breakfast restaurant that adding a small amount of milk helps you get fluffier scrambled eggs. Season to taste, I love oregano on my eggs. Set eggs aside."
- "Bring up heat to medium high and add oil. Add potatoes and cook all around. When the potatoes are brown ~70% of the way around add butter, garlic, onions and mushrooms. Season to taste. Stir constantly. I typically cook until the garlic gets on the darker end because it adds a bit of crunchy garlic texture in each bite that I like, but it&#39;s always up to you. Place on plate next to eggs."
- "Slice the avocados and place next to everything."
- "Garnish if desired and serve immediately. Enjoyed best next to an open window with a morning breeze, no technology, and a cup of coffee."
