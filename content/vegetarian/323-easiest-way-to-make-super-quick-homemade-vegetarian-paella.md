recipeinstructions:
- "In a large paella pan or wok, put a generous amount of olive oil. Sauté the diced onions and garlic. Once they are cooked, cut the Romano peppers into thin slivers and add to the pan to cook them through. Then cut the chestnut mushrooms into thin slices and add them to the pan and sauté. In a separate small bowl, add the saffron to a bit of boiling water (or hot milk, which I prefer) so that the water/milk absorbs the colour of the saffron."
- "Add the chopped tomatoes to the mix and cook the mixture for a few minutes. In pint glass of boiling water, dissolve a cube of vegetable stock and add this to the paella pan. Add the saffron water to the pan too and mix well."
- "Add the paella rice to the wok and ensure that rice is covered well by the liquid already in there. If it is not enough liquid, add a little more water."
- "On a medium heat, cook the rice down for 15-20 mins until the rice is al dente and most of the water is absorbed. It is important not to stir the rice at the point."
- "There is a crispy golden crust that forms on the bottom of the pan. It infuses the paella with a smoky and slightly nutty flavor. This is known as a Soccarat and this appears once the broth starts cooking off. You may also hear a light crackle and popping sound as this crust forms."
- "Once the liquid cooks off and a nice soccarat forms, add salt, paprika, lemon juice, thyme and pepper and gently mix it into the rice. Then add in the peas and stir it in gently."
- "Once the paella is cooked, cover the pan with foil for 10 minutes. Then garnish with some freshly chopped parsley and wedges of lemon."
