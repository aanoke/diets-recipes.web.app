recipeingredient:
- "3 cans sliced potatoes"
- "2 TBS butter"
- "1/4 C flour"
- "4 C milk"
- "10 veggie sausage patties"
- "1 can of 8 biscuits"
- "8 eggs"
- "1/8 C milk"
- "2 C shredded cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350"
- "Fry potatoes with a little oil on med heat until outsides are brown (usually 10-15 min) ** to avoid mushy potatoes, DRY them first! With paper towels, or bake in the oven for 5-10 minutes (or both!)"
- "Whisk eggs and 1/8C milk in a bowl. (You can use up to 12 eggs if your dish is big enough)"
- "Over low heat, melt 2 TBS butter in med saucepan, when melted, whisk with flour until little dough-balls form. Add about 4C milk and increase to high heat. Stir frequently, and AS SOON as it boils, drop heat back down to low."
- "Meanwhile, microwave veggie sausage patties, just enough to be thawed (If you&#39;re using meat sausage - you need to actually cook it first) (or just try the veggie ones. I use morningstar farms for this - no one knows the difference)"
- "Chop up (or pulse in blender) sausage and add to gravy. Let cook until gravy starts to thicken. Usually 8-10 minutes. Stir often! It will burn on the bottom! I add a good bit of salt and pepper too."
- "Grease casserole dish. Put potatoes on the bottom. Layer biscuits on top of potatoes."
- "Pour eggs (and make sure they thoroughly soak through to the bottom of the pan) Run a spatula around the edges to make sure eggs even out. Layer with cheese"
- "Lastly, pour on sausage gravy!"
- "I cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes on, 20 minutes off. (It can take less or longer depending on your pan. I use a deep casserole, glass, 9×13.) Just check the middle to make sure eggs aren&#39;t runny."
- "Cut into 8 servings-12 servings. Let it cool - the middle will be -ruin your tongue - hot!"
- "Note about exploding Pirex! There was a wave of more cheaply made Pirex (or the like) - usually with thinner handles or lighter feel - that is notorious for exploding in your oven. (Google exploding Pirex) Varied ingredient temperatures in layers is definitely a trigger for this! Because this has some pre-cooked/hot layers, I stick my well greased dish in the oven while pre-heating to warm it up first. &amp; I let my potatoes &amp; gravy sit for a minute - stirring to release steam-before adding!"
