I served my cheesy lentil burgers in the usual way - in a burger bun with some salad and slices of tomato. The vegan burger patties are made of brown lentils, tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, a grated carrot, an I&#39;m not vegan or vegetarian, but I&#39;d definitely eat these burgers! Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover and simmer until the lentils are fully softened and the liquid is. Lentils will be soft and most of the water will be gone.
