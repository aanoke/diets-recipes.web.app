I cooked in the oven for twenty minutes and then another twenty or so in a pot of bubbling sauce. Ground chicken: I highly recommend using ground chicken thighs and not chicken breast. Parmesan and almond flour: Both of these ingredients help keep the juices inside the chicken meatballs while they bake (similar to if you had used breadcrumbs). The parmesan also adds wonderful flavor. The meatballs stole the show and saved dinner.
