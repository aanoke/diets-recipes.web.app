I love edamame ginger and garlic. But this dip is not good. An easy to make and healthy dip I used half the amount of ginger and substituted a fresh habanero pepper and a tsp of horseradish instead of the hot sauce.. Remove from the heat, cool, and then slip off the skins. Serve this edamame dip with raw vegetables and crackers, or slather it on sandwiches or wraps.
