recipeinstructions:
- "My absolutely favourite vegetable is spinach. It has so nice colour that looks great on a white plate and its flavour is lovely.  First, you have to clean and wash spinach well so the dirt comes off. And I know, it looks like it&#39;s too much spinach for just two people, but you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not."
- "We&#39;re going to blanch the spinach, so finely chop it and put it in boiling water for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, it&#39;s very important to put blanched spinach in very cold water to save its beautiful green colour."
- "Next step is to melt butter and add chopped onion. When it got nice gold colour, add spinach."
- "Stir it for minute or two while you finely chop those hard boiled eggs. Add them to the spinach."
- "Final step is to mix milk with the flour and add it the spinach. Stir it well-and serve."
- "I always buy homemade sausages. I think it&#39;s important to buy meat from people you know because, honestly, we cannot be sure of what are meat industry putting in their sausages and other products.  The preparation is super-easy. Cut the sausages in half so you can get more interesting shape and crunchy sides. Fry it on a few drops of oil for 4 minutes."
- "I hope you&#39;ll like it. Enjoy in this spring dish! :)"
