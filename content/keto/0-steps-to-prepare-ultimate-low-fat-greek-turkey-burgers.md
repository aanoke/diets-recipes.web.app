Spray a nonstick grill pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat, or prepare the grill. Because of all of the add-ins, I thought the burger would have a difficult time holding together and would need the egg for extra binding power. Another keto or low carb option for the Greek turkey burgers is to use grilled portobello mushrooms! Portobello mushrooms are low-calorie, low fat, and low carb. I usually will grill up portobello mushrooms with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper and then serve those alongside the other condiments or toppings like lettuce, onions, and tomatoes.
