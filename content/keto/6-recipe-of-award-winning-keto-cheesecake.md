recipeingredient:
- " Crust"
- "2 cups blanched almond flour"
- "1/3 cup butter"
- "3 tbsp granulated stevia"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- " Filling"
- "48 oz cream cheese"
- "1 cup powdered steviaerythritol blend"
- "4 extra large eggs"
- "1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice"
- "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 10 in springform pan (or you can line the bottom with parchment paper). I usually grease the sides and line the bottoms with parchment paper."
- "For the crust, stir the almond flour, melted butter, stevia, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl, until well combined. It will be slightly crumbly. Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, until barely golden. Let cool at least 10 minutes."
- "For the filling, beat the cream cheese and powdered sweetener together at low to medium speed until fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Finally, beat in the lemon juice and vanilla extract. (Keep the mixer at low to medium the whole time; too high speed will introduce too many air bubbles, which we don&#39;t want.)"
- "Pour the filling into the pan over the crust. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for about 45 minutes, until the center is almost set, but still jiggly."
- "Leave cheesecake in the over with the oven off and the oven door partially open for one hour. Then let cool on the counter until room temperature. Lastly, refrigerate until set, as least four hours, preferably over night. Don’t remove cheesecake from pan before chilling."
- "Once chilled and set, slice, serve, and enjoy!"
